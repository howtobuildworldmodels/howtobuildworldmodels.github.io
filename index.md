# Tutorial on How to build World models 

Tutorial will take place at [Indian Conference on Computer Vision, Graphics and Image Processing (ICVGIP) 2025](https://icvgip.in/2025/) organised by IIT Mandi from Dec 17-20.

## Overview: Imagine, Plan, and Control with Generative Models ðŸš€

**World Models** are a powerful paradigm in deep learning that grants an agent the ability to learn a compact, predictive representation of its environment directly from its sensory data. This internal model can then be leveraged to simulate the future, enabling planning, exploration, and control without constant, costly interaction with the real world.

This half-day tutorial offers a comprehensive journey from the foundational theory of World Models (e.g., the original WorldModel paper and Dreamer architecture) to their modern implementation using state-of-the-art generative techniques. Attendees will gain the knowledge and practical skills needed to design, train, and apply these models in challenging computer vision and embodied AI tasks.


By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

1.  **Understand the Core Components:** Detail the roles of the **Vision Model** (**VAE/Vector-Quantized VAE**), the **Memory Model** (**Recurrent Dynamics**), and the **Controller** (**Policy Network**).
2.  **Appreciate Scalability:** Grasp the advancements in modern models that enable scaling World Models to high-fidelity, complex environments.
